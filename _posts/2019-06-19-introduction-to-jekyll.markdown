Jekyll is a simple static site generator. There are others in markets like hugo (*haven't used it*).
What makes it different is - it's blog aware and very simple.

> Built on Ruby

## Features
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) or [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile) support
- [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) templating.
- Out of the box blog-aware features

 - layouts
 - pages, posts ...
- Github site deployment
