We all have heard the power of compounding interest. Once the interest is added to the principal it contributes to future interest.

## Compounding of knowledge

Three main take away from the idea of compounding:

    1. Compounding leads to exponential growth curve
    2. The earlier compounding starts, the sooner you hit the rapid growth.
    3. Even a small deltas in the interest rates can make significant difference in long run.

Compounding can be applied to learning as well:

    1. Learning follows exponential growth. Initial growth is linear, but the foundation that is built, it would enable you to gain knowledge faster.
    2. The earlier you optimize for learning, the more time you have for learning to compound.
    3. Due to compounding, even small learnings can make a significant difference in long run.
